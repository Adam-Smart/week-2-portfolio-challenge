# week-2-portfolio-challenge
## Description

This website is a starting place for my portfolio which I will be using to show to potential employers in the future. This will be a place where I can display all of my work for employers to look at and see what I've worked on previously. When I've created more webpages and other applications I will be able to add them to this portfolio with images giving them a first look but then being able to click on the image which takes them to the deployed webpage. 

There is also an image of myself and some information about myself such as what I have previously studied in sixth form and also some of my hobbies and interests. Adding this shows some character to myself and also try to stand out from the rest of the crowd.

At the bottom of the page, I have included a footer that includes my telephone number, my e-mail address, and a link to my GitHub repositories so that potential employers can click on the link and can see what I've worked on in list form and then can look at the code I have implemented in them. 

The webpage has included flex allowing anyone to view it on different-sized devices but not affect any of the ???? that I have included there. When the screen size shrinks so should all of the elements within the webpage and changed the layout to make it more mobile-friendly.
