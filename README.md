# week-2-portfolio-challenge
## Description

This website is a starting place for my portfolio which I will be using to show to potential employers in the future. This will be a place where I can display all of my work for employers to look at and see what I've worked on previously. When I've created more webpages and other applications I will be able to add them to this portfolio with images giving them a first look but then being able to click on the image which takes them to the deployed webpage. 

There is also an image of myself and some information about myself such as what I have previously studied in sixth form and also some of my hobbies and interests. Adding this shows some character to myself and also try to stand out from the rest of the crowd.

At the bottom of the page, I have included a footer that includes my telephone number, my e-mail address, and a link to my GitHub repositories so that potential employers can click on the link and can see what I've worked on in list form and then can look at the code I have implemented in them. 

The webpage has included flex elements allowing it to be viewed on different-sized devices but not affecting any of the elements that I have included on the page. When the screen size shrinks so should all of the elements within the webpage and changed the layout to make it more mobile-friendly. 

## Problems and solutions

When creating the webpage an issue I ran into was changing the size of some of the images. More specifically the problem I ran into was one of the images with an included hyperlink wasn't properly sized making the clickable area larger than the image itself. This happened as I was changing the width of the image in ".work img" so the image itself was reducing in size but the whole ".work" class was still showing the full size of the link making the clickable area larger. I fixed this by making sure the ".work img" class keeps the size 100% and changed the size of the ".work" class to 49% instead, making the whole class smaller and keeping the image and hyperlink the same size.

## Usage
This webpage is designed to be used by myself and potential future employers. This helps me as this gives me a space where I can show off previous work that I have done and currently working on keeping it all in one place. This is useful for potential employers as they can see the work ive done before, all on one page with included links to the deployed application allowing them to explore by themself.
